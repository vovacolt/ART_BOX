Description:
=========================
Art-Box is an ecosystem for creating virtual art exhibitions. It allows you to view countless paintings in a confined space.

Art-Box consists of a server, a client application and a database. One or several exposures can be stored in the database and it is convenient to change them on the server side, without the need to update the client application.

The client application has the following functionality:
=========================
+ The user can enjoy the minimalistic interior of the virtual museum.

+ The paintings in the museum themselves update their content from time to time when the user is not looking at them.

+ The user has the ability to choose the environment from two color options: day and night.

+ All elements of the user interface, with the exception of the main menu, are brought to the stage in the form of 3D widgets so that no controls would distract the user from the pictures.

+ Sound control.

Control:
=========================
+ Movement: W, A, S, D
+ Interaction: paintwork
+ In the future it is planned:
+ Web tool for working with a database.
+ VR version of the project.
